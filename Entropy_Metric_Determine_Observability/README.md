# README #

There are no specific requirements on the version of MATLAB to run the code in this folder.


### What is this repository for? ###

All the code are based on an information-based metric observability, which has been used to quantify the observability of the global system from the local measurements of a single agent. Object oriented programming has been implemented, greatly improving the conveniency of analysis. Class *CATrafficDataProcess* and *CATrafficModelScaling* were defined in the folder. Additional work were conducted on the two classes.

### Topics Covered 

* Comparisons of dynamical behaviors at different densities
* Comparisons of dynamical behaviors at different spatial scales
* Comparisons of dynamical behaviors with different parameters, such as influenctial range, time window length for state estimation
