# README #

All the codes are running on MATLAB.

## What is this repository for? ##

#### Chaotic_Systems ####

These codes are based on the chaotic system dynamics, and we try to figure out the relationship between observability and entropy variation under different scales

#### Entropy_Metric_Determine_Observability ####

This folder contains the code to quantify the observability of statistical-mechancis based traffic through mutual information.

#### Neuron Systems ####
This folder covers simulation examples of neuron systems, single as well as coupled, to understand their behaviors.
